            I'm a passionate problem-solver, motivated by technical, business, and organizational challenges. I genuinely enjoy helping people through coding and empowering others to be their best version in this fantastic field. I have served as technical lead, collaborating with designers, developers, and project managers, to understand and execute client goals, consistently delivering on time and meeting client expectations. I have created and led internal developer knowledge-sharing workshops, helping elevate a culture of collaboration and feedback within the development team. As well as an internship program for marginalized groups, with high success in coaching interns and leading to full-time employment.
